        <h2>Coffee tastes better when it is strong!</h2>
        <h3>Do you agree</h3>
        <div style="border: 3px solid rgb(83, 21, 21)">
            <p>Turns out that coffee's good for more than jump-starting our mornings or keeping us awake during meetings. A lot of recent research suggests that coffee offers a host of potential health benefits.

                Every day, Americans drink 400 million cups of this incredibly complex beverage, which contains more than 1,000 compounds that can affect the body. The most commonly studied are caffeine (a nervous-system stimulant that's known to have positive cognitive effects) and polyphenols (antioxidants that can help slow or prevent cell damage).</p>

        <h2>TYPES</h2>
        <p class="type">The beans you brew are actually the processed and roasted seeds from a fruit, which is called a coffee cherry. The coffee cherry's outer skin is called the exocarp. Beneath it is the mesocarp, a thin layer of pulp, followed by a slimy layer called the parenchyma.</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li class="para"><p><b>Types of bean:</b>Coffee beans primarily come from four main types: Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, and Excelsa. Arabica beans are known for their smooth, complex flavors and aromatic qualities, making them the most popular choice for specialty coffees. Robusta beans, on the other hand, are stronger and more bitter with a higher caffeine content, often used in espresso blends. Liberica beans offer a unique, floral aroma and a distinctive, slightly woody flavor. Excelsa, a variety of Liberica, is less common but noted for its fruity and spicy notes. Each type contributes its own unique profile to the diverse world of coffee.</p></li><br>
            <li class="para"><p><b>Type of Roast:</b>Coffee roasts are typically categorized into three main types: light, medium, and dark. Light roasts retain most of the bean's original flavors and acidity, often highlighting fruity or floral notes. Medium roasts strike a balance between acidity and sweetness, offering a fuller body with a more developed flavor profile. Dark roasts, with their rich, bold flavors and diminished acidity, feature deep, smoky, and sometimes chocolatey notes. The roasting process affects not only the flavor but also the aroma and body of the coffee, catering to a wide range of preferences.</p></li><br>
            <li class="para"><p><b>Type of grind:</b>Coffee grinds vary in texture, and the right grind depends on the brewing method used. Coarse grind is used for methods like French press or cold brew, where a larger, chunkier texture ensures proper extraction and avoids over-extraction. Medium grind is suitable for drip coffee makers and pour-over brews, offering a balanced extraction that brings out the coffee's flavors without being too fine. Fine grind is used for espresso machines and Moka pots, where a finer texture helps create a rich, concentrated shot of coffee. Extra-fine grind is used for Turkish coffee, where the beans are ground to a powdery consistency to ensure a full extraction in the traditional brewing method. Each grind size plays a crucial role in achieving the desired taste and strength of the coffee.</p></li><br>
            <li class="para"><p><b>Decaffinated coffee:</b>Decaffeinated coffee offers a way to enjoy the rich flavors of coffee without the stimulating effects of caffeine. The decaffeination process typically involves removing most of the caffeine from the beans through methods such as the Swiss Water Process, which uses water to extract caffeine, or chemical solvents like methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. Although decaf coffee still contains a small amount of caffeine, it allows individuals sensitive to caffeine or those looking to reduce their intake to savor their coffee experience without the associated jitters or sleep disturbances.</p><br>
